### Favorite Vacation Spot - Lake of the Ozarks 
The main reason I like visiting Lake of the Ozarks compared to other places is because<br>
I love being on the water during the summer time. Whether it is boating, jet skiing, fishing or just <br>
hanging out at the beach. I also like that their isn't as much travel compared to other places I like to go to
