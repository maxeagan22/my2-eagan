I am a computer science major here at Northwest Missouri State University. One fact the most poeple don't know about me is that I am a triplet, dont see many of those around here. Some of the things I enjoy doing is playing video games, watching football, mostly the Chiefs. Hanging out with friends, go to the lake, and talking my dog for walks.
